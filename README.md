## Beam Wallet Service

This is the beam wallet service. It allows to implement lightweight wallets using BEAM API.

### Example client code & Private keys notice

The folder ./service/client contains an example Wallet Service client code. All the private keys inside are not used in production and included only for the sake of simplifying the example. It is advised to check your code based on this example and ensure that you do not expose any secrets publicly and keep them in your CI platform config storage.
